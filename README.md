# bem-bl blocks library

bem-bl is an extended library of blocks, that consists not only of basic blocks but also has a number of universal solutions to display a menu, text, logo, search tab, table, etc.

Current state of development: bem-bl is suspended and will not be filled with new blocks, however we provide user support and bug fixing. We recommend you to start new projects with [bem-core](http://bem.info/libs/bem-core/) instead of bem-bl.
